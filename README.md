# Enumerable Methods project

**This is my second Ruby project for Microverse**

# Getting started :

In this project, I'm cloning methods from the Enumerable module in Ruby. Basically I created most of the methods that Enumerable module contain.
Methods: #my_each, #my_each_with_index, #my_select, #my_all?, #my_any?, #my_none, #my_count, #my_map, #my_inject and #multiply_els.

# Prerequisites :

1- A Computer.
2- Ruby installed

# Setup :

Please install ruby, you may follow this guide from Odin Project webpage [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/installing-ruby-ruby-programming).

# Install :

Clone this [repository](https://github.com/FdI96/Project-2-Enumerable-Methods/tree/Features) from GitHub.

## Usage:

    -Change the directory with "cd" command to the directory cloned in your terminal.

    -Finally you may add to your library of methods and you can use it with any array.
