# Enumerable Methods project

**This is my second Ruby project for Microverse**

# Getting started :

In this project, I'm cloning methods from the Enumerable module in Ruby. Basically I created most of the methods that Enumerable module contain, I spend a lot time taking a look at the methods and trying to understand them, so then I went full on try to replicate them as much as I could. In first instance I created the "my_each" method which I used it then in the process to create other methods. In this project I've cut a little bit more the gap between ruby and me, creating theese methods. I totally took advantage from the yield statement which is the connection between a method and a piece of code (block)
